# DeNotify

This is a proof of concept [Deno](https://deno.land) version of [notify-rust](https://github.com/hoodie/notify-rust/).

There is not much there yet - just me playing with ways of exposing Rust APIs in TypeScript. You can tell the progress of this by the proportion examples [here](https://github.com/hoodie/denotify/tree/master/examples) and in the [Rust version](https://github.com/hoodie/notify-rust/tree/master/examples).
